            <h3> Short History</h3>
            <p>The Taj Mahal was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632 in Agra, India, as a mausoleum for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. It took around 22 years and over 20,000 workers to complete (finished in 1653).</p>

            <p>Made of white marble and adorned with precious stones, the Taj Mahal is a symbol of eternal love and a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, combining Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles.</p>

            <p>Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the World, attracting millions of visitors every year.</p>
