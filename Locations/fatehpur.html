            <h3> Short History</h3>
            <p>Fatehpur Sikri was built by the Mughal Emperor Akbar between 1571 and 1585 near Agra, India. It served as the capital of the Mughal Empire for about 14 years.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Akbar founded the city to honor the Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chishti, who blessed him with a son after years of childlessness.</li>
                <li>The city was designed as a grand, planned capital combining Islamic, Persian, and Indian architectural styles.</li>
                <li>Key monuments include the Buland Darwaza (Victory Gate), Jama Masjid, Panch Mahal, and the Diwan-i-Khas.</li>
                <li>Despite its grandeur, Fatehpur Sikri was abandoned around 1585 due to water shortages and strategic concerns.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Today, it stands as a well-preserved UNESCO World Heritage Site, showcasing the artistic and cultural brilliance of the Mughal era.</p>
