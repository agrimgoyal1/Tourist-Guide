            <h3> Short History</h3>
            <p>Agra Fort, located on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, is one of India's most significant Mughal-era forts. It was originally built as a brick fort by the Lodhi dynasty in the 15th century, but it gained its grand form under the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great in 1565–1573.</p>

            <ul>
                <li> Akbar rebuilt it in red sandstone, making it a military stronghold and royal residence.</li>
                <li>His grandson Shah Jahan later transformed parts of it into a palace complex with white marble structures like the Moti Masjid and Musamman Burj.</li>
                <li>It was also where Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb, and where he spent his last years, reportedly gazing at the Taj Mahal from his chamber.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Agra Fort has seen many rulers and battles, including being taken over by the Marathas, British, and eventually becoming part of modern India.</p>
            <p>In 1983, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its architectural brilliance and historic importance.</p>
