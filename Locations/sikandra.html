            <h3> Short History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sikandra was named after the Delhi Sultan Sikandar Lodi, who ruled before the Mughals and first developed this area.</li>
                <li>Emperor Akbar himself chose this site for his tomb and started its construction during his lifetime.</li>
                <li>The work was completed by his son Jahangir, who made some design modifications — especially to the upper structure.</li>
                <li>The tomb blends Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain architectural styles — reflecting Akbar’s philosophy of religious tolerance and his idea of “Sulh-i-Kul” (peace for all).</li>
                <li>Made primarily of red sandstone and white marble.</li>
                <li>The structure stands in the middle of a vast charbagh (four-part Persian garden) with fountains, pathways, and gateways.</li>
                <li>The main gateway, called the Buland Darwaza, is richly decorated with marble inlay and geometric patterns.</li>
                <li>Akbar’s actual tomb lies in a simple underground chamber.</li>
                <li>The monument is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and is part of the UNESCO tentative list for World Heritage Sites.</li>
                <li>The site also contains tombs of Akbar’s daughters, including Princess Shakrul Nissa Begum.</li>
